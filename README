This is a test run of Spread. Spread is a Java app supporting processing and 
visualizations of BEAST's phylogeographic models. Contains visualisations 
(templates), wrapped in a simplistic gui. Supported visualisations include 
embedded Processing applets and KML output for viewing in Google Earth.

                              TODO

* improve GUI looks & feels
   - set working path after opening first file
   - allow for saving panel settings
   - hide some options with "show more" buttons 
* TimeSlicer template
  - concurrent version of Polygons is out of sync with sliceTimes and 
    needs work, for now we run it sequentially
