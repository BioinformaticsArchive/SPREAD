S.P.R.E.A.D. is a Java program supporting processing and visualizations of BEAST's 
phylogeographic models. Contains visualisations (templates), wrapped in a user 
friendly interface. Supported visualisations include embedded Processing applets 
and KML output for viewing in Google Earth or any other virtual globe software 
capable of reading the format.

                              TODO
* Processing applets
   - We could draw the lines along great circle arcs or rhumb lines, this would require 
     getting the code in kml generator class to work with processing
* TimeSlicer template
  - give the concurrent implementation of AnalyzeTree another try. This might        
    be achieveable with ConcurrentHashMap class  
  - Polygons should also be easily executed in parallel (read only operation),
    the problem is in getting the style id's right
