SPREAD is a Java program supporting processing and visualizations of BEAST's phylogeographic models ("BEAST software":http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/Main_Page). 

Contains visualisations (templates), wrapped in a user friendly interface. Supported visualisations include embedded Processing applets and KML output for viewing in "Google Earth":http://www.google.com/earth or any other virtual globe software capable of reading the format.

A tutorial on using SPREAD is availiable "here":http://www.kuleuven.be/aidslab/phylogeography/tutorial/spread_tutorial.html

h1. COMPILING

Depends on the following libraries:

* jebl.jar
* org.boehn.kmlframework_20090320.jar
* core.jar
* colt.jar
* ColorPicker.jar
* quaqua.jar (libquaqua64.jnilib, libquaqua.jnilib)

Before exporting to a runnable jar change line 12 in templates.MapBackground.java:
boolean fromJar = false 
        to 
boolean fromJar = true 

h1. TODO

* New tab with cancel buttons for running jobs
* TimeSlicerTab
   - Check if Animation Thread is still running and only then release progress bar (currently it gets released when AnalyzeTrees method stops running)
* Add cannot impute, no precision attribute warning message in Time Slicer
* switch to Callable tasks
