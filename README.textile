h1. PURPOSE
                            
SPREAD-phy is a Java program supporting processing and visualizations of BEAST's phylogeographic models ("BEAST software":http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/Main_Page). 

Contains visualisations (templates), wrapped in a user friendly interface. Supported visualisations include embedded Processing applets and KML output for viewing in "Google Earth":http://www.google.com/earth or any other virtual globe software capable of reading the format.

A tutorial on using SPREAD-phy is availiable "here":http://www.kuleuven.be/aidslab/phylogeography/tutorial/spread_tutorial.html

h1. COMPILING

Depends on the following libraries:

* jebl.jar
* org.boehn.kmlframework_20090320.jar
* core.jar
* colt.jar
* ColorPicker.jar
* quaqua.jar (libquaqua64.jnilib, libquaqua.jnilib)

Before exporting to a runnable jar change line 14 in templates.MapBackground.java:
boolean fromJar = false 
        to 
boolean fromJar = true 

h1. TODO

* Progress bar for tree slicer (reading trees, assume 10 000 trees)
* Less dependencies:
 - add kmlframework to sources (if licenses compatible) 
* Improve custom slice heights
* Add command line interface for kml templates 
* Templates: collect data into ArrayList<Layer>, then pass it to KML Generator or Processing canvas. This way all the exceptions are caught beforehand.
* Fix large scaling factor issues
