h1. PURPOSE
                            
SPREAD is a Java program supporting processing and visualizations of BEAST's phylogeographic models ("BEAST software":http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/Main_Page). 

Contains visualisations (templates), wrapped in a user friendly interface. Supported visualisations include embedded Processing applets and KML output for viewing in Google Earth or any other virtual globe software capable of reading the format.


h1. DOWNLOAD
                            
Compiled version can be downloaded from "here":http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5169517/spread.jar

h1. COMPILING

Depends on the following libraries:

* jebl.jar
* org.boehn.kmlframework_20090320.jar
* core.jar
* colt.jar
* ColorPicker.jar
* quaqua.jar (libquaqua64.jnilib, libquaqua.jnilib)


h1. TODO

* Top priority: memory leak in Time Slicer template  
* Processing applets
   - We could draw the lines along great circle arcs or rhumb lines, this would require getting the code in kml generator class to work with processing
* Add Cannot impute, no precision attribute warning message in Time Slicer
* Add drop-down panels, FigTree style
* Add a list with default operations and place check-marks next to them before a map comes up
